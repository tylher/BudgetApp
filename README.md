## Budget App
This is a web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category so that you can see how much money you spend and on what.

This is a Ruby on Rails application that allows the users to:

- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- Introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- See the money spent on each category.
